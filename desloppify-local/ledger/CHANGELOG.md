# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Deployment Changelog

**Purpose:** Log of all deployments with timestamps, commits, and status

---

## How to Use

After each deployment, add an entry:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - Environment

- Commit: abc123f
- Backend: service-name (platform)
- Frontend: https://your-url.com
- Database migrations: yes/no
- Status: ✅ Deployed / ❌ Failed / 🔄 Rolled Back
- Notes: Brief description of changes
```

**Automated logging:**
- `/menu` → 3 (Deploy Workflow) offers to update this file
- `/menu` → 4 (End Session) can also log deployments
